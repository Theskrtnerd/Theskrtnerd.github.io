      <description>Hi, I just started building this blog ðŸ‘¶. I&amp;rsquo;ll try to spend more time writing blogs and stuff to update all my stuff here.
I had a meeting for the WDC Web Project today. My job in this project is to build the front-end for a volunteering website. This might be a good project for my list of projects.
I also had a short talk with a World Quant recruiter today.</description>

      <description>Today is a good day for me ðŸ¥°. I did pretty well in the Algorithm Design &amp;amp; Data Structure Prac Exam 2, which was a comeback from Prac Exam 1. Hopefully I can get better grade than OOP for this course.
I&amp;rsquo;m also having a meeting with Tobin about the internship and our progress in 30 minutes. It&amp;rsquo;s been a while seen our last meeting, and there will be a lot to talk about.</description>

      <description>Today I got rejected from another company. ðŸ˜ž Almost, like literally almost every single company I applied to has rejected me. Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s my communications skill, but maybe there&amp;rsquo;s something more to it.
At least on the research side, I&amp;rsquo;m doing pretty well (i guess). The meeting with Tobin the other day went fine. I guess now we&amp;rsquo;ll pivot to a different type of model, Diffusion model. I&amp;rsquo;m now trying to replicate the paper&amp;rsquo;s results, and writing some code to finetune a backdoor model myself.</description>

      <description>I had 2 big dinners the past 2 days. One was with my house, and one was with all my friends. It was super fun but tiresome. But I&amp;rsquo;m starting to feel like I&amp;rsquo;m spending a lot of time for sports. Although they are quality time, spending too much will stop me from other activities like Gym. So maybe I will need to make some time for Gym.
Also, I feel like I need to find a part-time job now.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been quite long since my last daily status (~4 days). A lot has happened ig. SQUAD participated in the YouX Games Night the other day and got second prize - 30$ voucher to watch movies. It was a bit sad as we were so close to winning the first prize.
Also, as a project lead of SQUAD, me and the team will do a new personal project now. It&amp;rsquo;s a Sports betting bot, and hopefully we can produce something out of this, and make the resume prettier (at least for Quant).</description>

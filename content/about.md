### Introduction

Hi there! I’m Viet Bach Tran — but feel free to call me Bach or Barry (Viet is actually my middle name).

I’m a second-year Bachelor of Computer Science (Advanced) student at the University of Adelaide, majoring in Artificial Intelligence.

I’m currently doing a Machine Learning Engineer internship at Canva, working on an exciting project in Design Relayout.

I’m very passionate about AI research, with interests in a variety of topics like Visual Counting, Quant Finance, Backdoor Attack, Medical AI, Design Generation, and Ads Auctions. In other words, I’m curious about all areas of machine learning and how to apply it to various aspects of life.

I’m currently serving as the president of the Adelaide University Mathematics Society (AUMS) and was previously a project manager for the Society of Quantitative Analysis and Data (SQUAD).

Outside of academics, you can find me playing soccer on Sundays, solving random puzzles on the bus, or staying up really really late playing games with friends.

If you’d like to connect, chat, or discuss anything — from AI and machine learning to puzzles and games — feel free to reach out! I’m usually on platforms under the username ***xineohperif*** (firephoenix reversed).

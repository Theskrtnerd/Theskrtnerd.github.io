Since my last [*Top of Mind*](/posts/slow-down-or-move-fast/) a few months ago, life has taken a turn I never would’ve expected. As I write this, I'm on a flight to the US for what promises to be an exciting and chaotic 14-day adventure across Boston, New York, and San Francisco. I’ll be attending the Media Lab Members Week, exploring New York with my friend Khanh, and meeting (and crashing with) the Paraform founders for my startup, Lyra—where I’ll even be doing a blindfolded Rubik’s cube performance. I'll also be there for Tobin’s PhD defence, and more spontaneous moments I can’t fully anticipate yet. After the US, I’ll head to Melbourne for five days to catch up with friends and—well, more (😙 iykyk).

Amid this whirlwind, I’ve also had to let go of a few commitments. I stepped down from my role as President of the Maths Society (after some serious depression and consideration), withdrew from my Chinese class, and resigned as a PASS Leader at Uni. My priorities have shifted dramatically in just a few short months. I’ve realized that, at least for now, I don’t have the capacity to handle and care for all the activities and the ones I care about. Also I don't think now I can engage deeply in formal AI research or focus on building foundational skills in the same way I once planned. Life has moved too quickly, and it’s forced me to re-evaluate what’s most important in the present moment.

This rapid pace has made me reflect on whether my life has ever truly been “stable.” The philosophy I held during my last *Top of Mind* no longer seems to apply. But maybe that’s the point. Chaos, after all, is what makes life interesting. When I look at friends like Tobin and Zac, their lives are also full of unpredictable twists and turns—and yet, they're thriving. So for now, I’ll lean into the chaos, let go of the overwhelm, and simply embrace the moment.

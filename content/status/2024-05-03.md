Today I got rejected from another company. ðŸ˜ž Almost, like literally almost every single company I applied to has rejected me. Maybe it's my communications skill, but maybe there's something more to it.

At least on the research side, I'm doing pretty well (i guess). The meeting with Tobin the other day went fine. I guess now we'll pivot to a different type of model, Diffusion model. I'm now trying to replicate the paper's results, and writing some code to finetune a backdoor model myself.

And we also received the result for IMC prosperity. We ranked #251 out of 9.1k teams around the world. It's a decent result, but honestly I expected a better result. But I dropped out after the third round so who am I to blame ðŸ¥². But yeah, a main takeaway after the comp is to try and play simple, optimize. And another takeaway is a comp might not be that well-prepared.

Other than that, I think Uni is going well. Although I have an STATS assignment due today (like it's already been extended by 1 day), so we'll have to finish that.

It's been quite long since my last daily status (~4 days). A lot has happened ig. SQUAD participated in the YouX Games Night the other day and got second prize - 30$ voucher to watch movies. It was a bit sad as we were so close to winning the first prize.

Also, as a project lead of SQUAD, me and the team will do a new personal project now. It's a Sports betting bot, and hopefully we can produce something out of this, and make the resume prettier (at least for Quant).

As for the MIT internship, although now we've got a plan, the stuff we're doing is super similar, if not exactly, to a paper. It's kinda weird, but that's the plan for now. Maybe because of that, I'm feeling a bit unmotivated to work on this project right now.

I will have the AUMS pub crawl tmr. Hopefully this one will go much better than the previous one, where I left super early. Now I have friends there, so hopefully I don't go crazy haha.

Lastly, a really cool side personal project I'm interested in right now is the custom newtab page. From my brother's request to add a search bar, I've decided to add more features in. I'll my finance balance, notes from Google Keep. Combined with Google Calendar and quotes, I think this will be my new favourite project as I wouldn't have to show the address bar and the tabs bar as well.

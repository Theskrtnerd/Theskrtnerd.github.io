Today's a pretty productive day for me. I've essentially completed all my uni assignments and the tasks needed for this week. Tomorrow I'll have a hangout with friends so that's something to look foward to.

Still, I have 2 projects to look after. One is the MIT internship as I need to clean the codebase. The other is the Cinnamon AI project - I only have a week left to submit the project. So hopefully, I can spend the time doing them on Saturday and Sunday.

One last thing is that I need to force myself to work online on Outlier, as I would love to save some money for the US trip.

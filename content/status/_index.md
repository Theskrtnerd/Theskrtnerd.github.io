My life's been going quite well, I'd say. After doing research on Uni of Toronto for a while, I feel like I can definitely do an exchange and do some cool stuff there. It's starting to feel like I'm productively spending my Uni time, and finally being able to catch up with what I want. Although most of them are just plans, I still have a glimpse of hope that these things will turn true, and I can spend the best time of my life doing stuff I really want to do.

That's it for the deep shit. Other than that, I have Uni work and the MIT internship to worry. Fortunately, The Cinnamon AI thing is 90% finished now. Still procrastinate now and then but let's hustle until the end of the semester.

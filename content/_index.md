Hi! I'm Bach (Barry) Tran. I'm a final-year Computer Science (Advanced) student at the University of Adelaide, with a lifelong love for maths, coding, and more recently, AI and ML.

I like to say that AI/ML is often the second-best solution to every problem - not always perfect, but incredibly flexible and powerful. That mindset drives me to explore how it can be applied across domains and modalities, in both an applied and research context.

Outside of academics, I'm a part-time life enjoyer, the reluctant captain of my friend group's very average soccer team, an aspiring indie guitarist (the roommates can confirm), and an occasional entertainer with, objectively, some of the worst and best jokes you'll ever hear.

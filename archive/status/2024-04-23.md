Hi, I just started building this blog ðŸ‘¶. I'll try to spend more time writing blogs and stuff to update all my stuff here.

I had a meeting for the WDC Web Project today. My job in this project is to build the front-end for a volunteering website. This might be a good project for my list of projects.

I also had a short talk with a World Quant recruiter today. They seem kinda cool, although I'll probably not getting an internship there, due to my study.

I had 2 big dinners the past 2 days. One was with my house, and one was with all my friends. It was super fun but tiresome. But I'm starting to feel like I'm spending a lot of time for sports. Although they are quality time, spending too much will stop me from other activities like Gym. So maybe I will need to make some time for Gym.

Also, I feel like I need to find a part-time job now. It's just past the important part of the semester, and I currently don't have any source of income. So that might be something to consider.

And now might be a good time to focus on my WDC project, and the MIT internship project as well. And after that, I can focus on my own personal project.

I have the Pubcrawl and Games Night this week which I look foward to, but before that I need to focus on all the stuff above.

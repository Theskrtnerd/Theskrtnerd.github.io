It's been quite long since my last daily status. Right now I felt kinda depressed, as I've wasted the last 2 days doing random stuff, and not focus on stuff that I actually need to do.

I will be traveling back to Vietnam in a month, and that seems to be quite exciting. I will be able to meet my friends, family, and do all the stuff I've been wanting to do if I come back to Vietnam. All the food tour, going around Hanoi, study cafe, and soccer matches await me. Also, I'll be going on 2 trips, one to Thanh Hoa, and one to China, which's also exciting.

Furthermore, I have a really high chance of being able to join an AI bootcamp in Hanoi, and that will definitely take a lot of my time as well. I also have a small chance of getting in the Jane Street See Program, which will allow me to go to Hongkong for free. So in general, my summer break (winter break in Australia) sounds very promising, and it might become my best summer ever.

Other than all of that, Tobin just told me and Khanh about us being able to travel to MIT in a few months, which is very exciting. But in order to achieve that, we need to put more work into the project, and prepare for all the stuff we'll be doing if we come there.

In conclusion, a lot of cool stuff is happening soon, and all I need to do now is finish all the Uni work before the summer break and prepare for all the fun ahead.

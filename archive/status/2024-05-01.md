Today is a good day for me ðŸ¥°. I did pretty well in the Algorithm Design & Data Structure Prac Exam 2, which was a comeback from Prac Exam 1. Hopefully I can get better grade than OOP for this course.

I'm also having a meeting with Tobin about the internship and our progress in 30 minutes. It's been a while seen our last meeting, and there will be a lot to talk about. I'll update about the meeting tmr.

It's been a while since I started this blog. I'll try to make this daily status a habit (at least try to), and hopefully and I can have something to write about everyday.
